# classical-refs-in-ConDE-corpus
Material for an [article proposal](https://rmblf.be/2022/02/04/appel-a-contribution-lire-les-classiques-en-normandie/)

This repository will host the queries and their results for a study on the classical readings of Norman customary law commentators, as observable within the [ConDÃ‰ corpus](https://github.com/RIN-ConDE/editions).
This README file will be updated as I work.
