# classical-refs-in-ConDE-corpus
Material for an article proposal

This repository will host the queries and their results for a study on the classical readings of Norman customary law commentators, as observable within the [ConDÃ‰ corpus](https://github.com/RIN-ConDE/editions).
This README file will be updated as I work.
