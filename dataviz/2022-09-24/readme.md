# Visualizations with external tools

These visualizations are made with tables from the `../../output/dataviz_20220924_2057` folder. One of them is a Json file. It was made using [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio-app/#/upload) and the [by_custAuthor_20220924_2057.csv](../../output/dataviz__20220924_2057/by_custAuthor_20220924_2057.csv) file, and is meant to be re-uploaded to Palladio for live display. The rest was made using the bar chart tools on [RawGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) and the same CSV file. Videos are included to document the parameters used here.
